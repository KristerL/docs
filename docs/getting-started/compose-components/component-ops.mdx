Each component in Bit has its own build pipeline. The build pipeline and other features are managed through [Component Development Environments](/envs/overview) (envs). An env is similar to a set of npm-scripts managed as a component.  
This approach has several benefits, for example:

- Clean your codebase from configuration files.
- Versioning for your build pipeline and tooling configuration.
- Standardize build process by applying the same env on many components.
- Ability to apply unique build process on each component using variants.

## Developer Workflow Commands

[Environment Services](/envs/services/overview) define what tools would run and their configs. These services correspond to the different Bit commands you can use while building with Bit.

### `start`

The workspace UI displays your components. The component's env defines the configuration for the dev-server rendering documentation and compositions. Run workspace UI and see the list of dev-servers operated by the different environments. All dev-servers are then presented in the same app using iFrames for compositions (so both Angular and React components can be rendered in the same app).

```sh
bit start
```

```sh title="Running workspace UI with components configured with 2 envs"
ENVIRONMENT NAME                    URL                                          STATUS
teambit.react/react                 http://localhost:3300                        RUNNING
teambit.harmony/node                http://localhost:3301                        RUNNING


You can now view 'my workspace' components in the browser.
Bit server is running on http://localhost:3000
```

### `compile`

Bit allows a single command to compile all components in your workspace, regardless to the specific Compiler configured to them. For example, this allows some of your components to be compiles with [TypeScript](/aspects/typescript) and others with [Babel](/aspects/babel) (or different configs for the same compiler as different envs might use different `tsconfig.json` or `.babelrc.js`).

```sh
bit compile
```

```bash
  STATUS  COMPONENT ID
✔ SUCCESS templates/envs/my-react # Using the Aspect env which is set to use the `Babel` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS templates/pages/welcome # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS templates/ui/card # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS templates/ui/heading # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS templates/ui/text # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS ui/my-welcome # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.

✔ 6/6 components compiled successfully.
Finished. (3s)
```

`bit watch` uses the same operation as `compile`.

```bash
bit watch
```

### `test`

Running tests for components built with purposes may result in requiring vastly different configurations and approaches. For example, for UI components you may want to set visual regression testing, while for utils this is less relevant. Some components may also need different testers.  
The [tester](/tester/overview) service knows to run tests and extract their results to a standardized format to be presented in the UI.

```bash
bit test
```

```bash
testing total of 6 components in workspace 'my-workspace'
testing 5 components with environment company.scope/templates/envs/my-react

 PASS  ui/my-welcome/my-welcome.spec.tsx

### `build`

[Builder](/builder/overview) service composes the [build pipeline](/builder/build-pipelines) from tasks implemented by other [services](/envs/services/overview) such as [Compiler](/compiler/overview) or [Tester](/tester/overview).

```bash title="Run the build pipeline"
bit build
```

<Image src={builderImg} width="100%" />

To learn about building components and the Builder, head over to the [Builder documentation](/builder/overview) section.

### `lint`

Depending on the environment configured on components, components in the same workspace may have different linting rules. Still, the operation itself is the same as all other services.

```bash
bit lint
bit lint --fix
```

To learn more about linting components and the Linter, head over to the [Linter documentation](/linter/overview) section.

### `format`

Depending on the environment configured on components, components in the same workspace may have different formatting rules. Still, the operation itself is the same as all other services.

```bash
bit format
```

To learn more about the Formatter, please head over to the [Formatter documentation](/formatter/overview) section.

## Get Env configuration

To examine what is the composition of a specific [Env](/envs/overview) including the tools used and their configuration, use the `bit env [id]` command.

```bash
bit env ui/my-welcome
```

```bash
Environment: teambit.react/react
teambit.compilation/compiler

configured compiler: teambit.typescript/typescript (TypeScript @ 4.3.5)
compiler config:
{
  ... // tsconfig properties
}


teambit.defender/tester

configured tester: teambit.defender/jest (Jest @ 26.6.3)
tester config:

module.exports = {
  ... // jest configuration
};

teambit.pipelines/builder

total 6 tasks are configured to be executed in the following order
1. teambit.harmony/aspect:CoreExporter
2. teambit.compilation/compiler:TSCompiler
3. teambit.defender/tester:TestComponents
4. teambit.pkg/pkg:PreparePackages
5. teambit.pkg/pkg:PublishDryRun
6. teambit.preview/preview:GeneratePreview
```
