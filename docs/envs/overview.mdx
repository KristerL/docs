An Env is a component development environment encapsulated as an independent component.  
Envs offer a fast and simple way to set components to use a pre-defined collection of development tools and configurations (compilers, testers, linters, build workflows, etc.)

The development tools are used by the Env are each "wrapped" by a Bit Aspect so that they can hook into Bit's CLI, build workflow, Workspace UI, component previews, and more.

You can use Bit's out-of-the-box Envs, extend and customize them, or create your own ones from scratch.
Much like any other independent component, Envs can be shared, collaborated on, and reused across Bit workspaces.
Reusing shared Envs greatly speeds up the development process and standardizes component development across decoupled workspaces.

A single Bit workspace can use multiple Envs for different components.

## Using Envs

### Using a default Env for the workspace

Envs can only be configured using the `teambit.workspace/variants` workspace API. That means the `teambit.workspace/workspace` cannot be utilized to set an environment as the default for all components. To achieve a similar result, select all components using the `*` wildcard.

For example:
<!-- TODO: consider removing the options to use * (replace with other example) -->
```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "*": {
      "teambit.react/react": {}
    }
  }
}
```

> <p style={{ color: '#c31313' }}>
>   Never use the '*' wildcard in a workspace that uses multiple environments!
> </p>
> Instead, use exclusive namespaces or directories to select and configure each group
> of components to use its own environment (see an example in the next section).

- **For a list of all available pre-configured Envs, [see here.](/pre-configured-envs/angular)**

### Using multiple Envs

A single workspace can use different Envs for different sets of components. Setting an environment on a specific group of components is done by selecting the group and applying the environment. This is done using [Variants](/workspace/variants).

For example, to set the Node and React environments on two sets of components (selected by their directory):

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "components/ui": {
      "teambit.react/react": {}
    },
    "components/utils": {
      "teambit.harmony/node": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### verify components' using Envs 
To make sure each component configured with the correct env, is recommended to run
```bash
bit envs
```
This will show a list of all of the workspace components and their corresponding env.

├─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
│ company.scope/ui/text       │ company.scope/envs/my-react │
└─────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘
```

Also, a component is not allowed to use more than one env at the same time.
To make sure you don't have any issues with your components' envs, run `bit status`
In case you have a comopnent with more than one env, you will see a section like this:
<!-- TODO: add cli output example of bit envs -->
```bash
new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > envs/my-react ...  issues found       
       multiple envs (remove the old envs by setting them with "-" sign in the variants. see https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/aspects/variants#removing-aspects ):

see troubleshooting at https://docs.bit.dev/docs/add-and-isolate-components#common-isolation-errors
```

This might happen when you have a component which is matched by more than one selector in the variants, and each one of the rules configure a different env.

In order to solve it, see envs Troubleshooting <!-- TODO: add link to envs Troubleshooting -->

## Inspecting an env
To see the env services configuration use `bit env <component-id>`.
See inspecting-an-env <!-- TODO: add link  --> for more details

## CLI Commands

Bit Envs hook into Bit's CLI to execute their different services. For example, `bit test`, will execute different test runners, depending on the environment in use.

### envs

See all components' corresponding env or inspect specific env

```shell
bit envs [component-id]
```

### start

Runs the development serve (that includes running the Workspace UI).

```shell title="run the dev server"
bit start
```

### build

Runs the build pipeline (without tagging components with a new release version).

```shell
bit build
```

### test

Runs all tests.

```shell
bit test
```

### compile

Compiles all components.

```shell
bit compile
```

### lint

Lints all components.

```shell
bit lint
```

### format

Formats all components.

```shell
bit format
```
