## Overview

Learn how to install a dependency to your workspace and how Bit automates dependency management. Learn how to install components to other projects and how to install components on CI.

## Install Dependencies

We depend on each other's code and components so we don't have to re-implement code. With Bit we can install components as dependencies. To install a dependency in your workspace, use the `bit install` command:

```sh
bit install @my-org.scope/my-component
```

Bit installs `@my-org.scope/my-component` as a dependency to your workspace and automatically adds it to the dependency policy in your `workspace.jsonc` file:

```js {6} title="workspace.jsonc"
...
"teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "packageManager": "teambit.dependencies/pnpm",
    "policy": {
      "dependencies": {
        "@my-org.scope/my-component": "1.0.0"
      }
    }
}
...
```

`@my-org.scope/my-component` is installed in the workspace but is not added as a dependency to any component.

### Adding a Dependency to a Component

Bit automates dependency management by finding all `import` statements in your code and resolving them to the installed dependency in your workspace. To add the component as a dependency:

```js title="my-component.tsx"
import { MyComponent } from '@my-org.scope/my-component';
```

## Viewing Component Dependencies

To view component dependencies run the `bit show` command followed by the component id:

```sh
bit show <component-id>
```

## Install Components in Other Projects

Components once exported to a remote scope can be consumed in any other project/app with the package manager of your choice.

```bash
npm install @my-org.scope/my-component
yarn add @my-org.scope/my-component
```

### Authenticate Package Manager with Bit.dev

When using bit.dev for hosting components and as a source for installing components, consumers will need to configure their package manager to know where to fetch components from. Do this by configuring [`npmrc`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/npmrc) file:

1. First of all - [install Bit](/getting-started/install-bit) on your system.
1. Run the following command:

```sh
bit login
```

1. Bit generated a `.npmrc` in your user-home directory (`~` in macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%` in Windows) with a basic config containing your authentication token.
1. Open the `.npmrc` file and add the following line (complete the account name according to where components are hosted)

```sh
@ACCOUNT:registry=https://node.bit.dev
```

An example configured `.npmrc` file looks something like this:

```sh
@teambit:registry=https://node.bit.dev
//node.bit.dev/:_authToken=<TOKEN>
```

### For Self-hosted Components

When self hosting Bit on your own server you need to publish the components as packages to any package registry. The authentication process for the pakage manager is very much the same other then the fact you can't use `bit login` to set your token.
