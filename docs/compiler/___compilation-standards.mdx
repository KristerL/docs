## Module formats

### ESM
ESM is the preferred format by bundlers. Bundlers use that for important features like Code Splitting and Tree Shaking.
ESM module targets would require an additional compilation step to execute from a NodeJS app. 

### CommonJS
CommonJS is the format used widely by NodeJS. CommonJS compiled components can be consumed from any Node application without
any further compilation steps. This NodeJS usability benefits come on the expanse of being optimized for the use of common
browsers since bundler optimization features such as: Code Splitting or Tree Shaking would be not apply.

## Target formats

Bit uses ES2015 as an ECMA specification target by default. This ensures out-of-the-box support from both NodeJS and common
bundlers such as Webpack or Rollup. 

### Compiling to multiple formats
@eden/@gilad: show how to do this with the Multi Compiler.

## Source Maps
During development, components should be compiled with source maps to ease debugging across browsers and IDEs.

## Types
Types are being generated upon component build. During development, Bit links component types through symlinks that point
directly to the component source files for types to be resolved by IDEs efficiently and without latency.
