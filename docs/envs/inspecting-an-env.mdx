Inspecting an env let you see the different configuration of your env.
This includes data like:
- the name of the env
- names of integrated tools (webpack/ts/babel/jest)
- integrated tool version (like webpack version or ts version)
- integrated tool config (like webpack/ts config)
- build pipeline tasks

In case you customized/extend another env, this command will show the data after all the calculation/mutation by the extending env.
This way you can see the final configuration of your env.
