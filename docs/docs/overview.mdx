Docs are handled by the preview aspect. You can turn them off using:

```json
"teambit.preview/preview": {
  "disabled": false
},
```

at you `workspace.jsonc`. (this will skip the docs step during tag, potentially saving build time)

### Compositions:

Compositions are "usage examples" of a component, and appear in the overview page in the "Compositions" section, or in the "Compositions" tab as full standalone pages. You can open them in a new tab, and share them to anyone who has access to the component.
Compositions are loaded from a `*.compositions?.(j|t)sx?`, and automatically include everything exported from the file. The file has a similar structure to Storybook's Compact Story Format.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-C9KDwRxGDAL-d1OcWucUIkf2OJmOTmvfvIFjyyuRiI/edit?usp=sharing
for example:

```tsx
import { Button } from './button';
export HeavyButton = () => <Button>HEAVY<Button>
```

- The export named `Preview` is the default composition. (`export default () => {}` has no special meaning, and will be repurposed in the future)
- You can also apply styles with the `canvas` syntax, but this only applies to the overview page.

```tsx
export WideButton = () => <Button>wide button</Button>
WideButton.canvas = {
    width: '200px'
}
```

- it's better to just apply size directly to the composition, though

```tsx
export WideButton = () => <div style={{width: '200px'}}><Button>wide button</Button></div>
// even better:
export WideButton = () => <Button style={{width: '200px'}}>wide button</Button>
```

### docs / overview

The component "overview" tab presents information about the component.
Automatic properties:

- Description (sub title) - is automatically calculated from js-docs on the component. Assume this will be markdown in the future
- Compositions - preview the compositions for this component.
- Properties - bit automatically calculates props using `react-docgen-typescript` (TODO - verify!), showing default value, required, jsdocs description. We are going to greatly improve this in the near future.
  Manual properties:
- Simplest way to document a component is using a `*.docs.mdx` file.  
  Simply write everything there in markdown format, and it will appear in the overview page.

````md
<!-- MDX allow import assets from other files -->

import { Button } from './button';
A useful button with automatic `loading` state management

### state

...

```ts
code example
```

<Button>you can embed regular jsx in MDX </Button>

```ts live
<button loading={true}>this will turn into a WYSIWYG live editor!</button>
```
````

- You can achieve the same result with a plain javascript es module:

```ts
export default = () => (
  <div>Buttons communicate actions that users can take. For examples:
    <ul>
      <li>forms</li>
      <li>menus</li>
      <li>basically everywhere</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
);
export const labels = ["react", "ui", "button"]
export const abstract = "A reusable button component.";
export const examples = [
  {
    title: "Outlined button";
    description: "The outline prop can be used to add border to the button";
    scope: { Button: Button };
    code: `<Button outline={true}>outlined</Button>`;
  },
  {
    title: "full button";
    description: "The full prop can be used to set background to the button";
    scope: { Button: Button };
    code: `<Button background={true}>outlined</Button>`;
  },
]
```

The format for docs.ts file is available here - https://bit.dev/teambit/documenter/types/docs-file
Finally, you can express the same properties in the MDX file as well. Simply add a yaml at the top of the MDX file:

```yaml
---
description: 'Renders text in a p element'
labels: ['paragraph']
---
import { Text } from "./text";
export const examples = [
    {
        title: "full button",
        description:
            "The full prop can be used to set background to the button",
        scope: { Text: Text },
        code: `<Text  text="some content"/>`,
    },
];
```

(examples should be expressible in the top yaml, but it doesn't seem to be, at the moment)
