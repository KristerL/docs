## multiple envs

When you see on your `bit status` command something like

```bash
     > pages/welcome ...  issues found
       multiple envs (remove the old envs by setting them with "-" sign in the variants. see https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/aspects/variants#removing-aspects ):
          company.scope/envs/my-react, teambit.react/react
```

It means that your component configured with more than one env, which is not allowed.
In order to solve it you can do different things.
Lets take a workspace.jsonc example which lead to this state:

```json
{
  //...
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "*": {
      "teambit.react/react": {}
    },
    "{pages/**}": {
      // uses the custom env
      "company.scope/envs/my-react": {}
    },
}
```

In this case the pages/welcome component get both the `teambit.react/react` env by the `"*"` rule and the `"company.scope/envs/my-react"` by the `"{pages/**}"`.
What you can do is either:

- exclude the `{pages/**}` selector from the `"*"` selector by changing `"*"` -> `"*", !{pages/**}`.
- mention the env you want to use explicitly using the `teambit.envs/envs` config.
by changing
```js
"{pages/**}": {
  // uses the custom env
  "company.scope/envs/my-react": {}
},
```
to 
```js
"{pages/**}": {
  // uses the custom env
  "company.scope/envs/my-react": {},
  // explicitly mention the env to use
  "teambit.envs/envs": {
    "env": "company.scope/envs/my-react"
  }
},
```
:::note
This solution will not remove the `"teambit.react/react"` from being an aspect dependency of the `pages/**` components.
so unless you really need both aspects to be applied it's better to use one of the other methods.
:::
- remove the `teambit.react/react` from the `{pages/**}` config by changing:

```
"{pages/**}": {
  // uses the custom env
  "company.scope/envs/my-react": {}
},
```

to

```
"{pages/**}": {
  // removing the default react env configured by the "*" selector
  "teambit.react/react": "-",
  // uses the custom env
  "company.scope/envs/my-react": {}
},
```

(see the added `"teambit.react/react": "-"`)

:::note
In case your component tagged previsouly with mulitiple envs, or with a different env, you now have to remove it explictly (as aspects will be copied from previously tagged version <!-- TODO: add link to explanation about this -->)
To do it, just make sure to use the remove aspect syntax `"teambit.react/react": "-"`. Once the component tagged again without the old env, you can usually remove this from the configuration.
